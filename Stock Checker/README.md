# Stock Checker

* Regularly checks the stock status of a given set of UPCs and/or URLs across a variety of different retailers, using APIs when available and web scraping otherwise.
* Sends text messages when critical items come back in stock.
* Supported Retailers:
  * Walmart
  * Kohls
  * Toys R Us (RIP)
  * Amazon support would be trivial; but was not requested.

Hasn't been updated to handle changes to the websites etc.; not in a working state.
