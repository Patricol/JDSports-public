# UploadTrackingData

* Used to automatically upload shipping fulfillment information requested by Amazon; by matching the orders in their request with order confirmation emails we receive from the wholesalers.
* Allows the user to save a local copy of the matches if they desire to do so.
* Alerts the user with details if any order confirmation email:
  * does not correspond to an Amazon order
  * was formatted such that the required information could not be pulled
