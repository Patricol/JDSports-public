# ProductIDConverter

## Impact
"Tough to translate as doing this manually would take forever. Saves 5-10 hours per week."â€‹

## Function
* Quickly converts between UPCs, ASINs (Amazon's product identifier,) and WalmartIDs, when given an Excel sheet with rows that each contain at least one of the three IDs.

This repository only contains README files and some portions of [WalmartRefunder](https://github.com/Patricol/JDSports-public/tree/master/WalmartRefunder#walmartrefunder) and [AddressPaster](https://github.com/Patricol/JDSports-public/tree/master/AddressPaster#address-paster) approved (by JD Sports) for public release.
